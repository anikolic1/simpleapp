## Getting Started
You can pull from git using 
```

```
then build and export the project using your favorite IDE.

## Usage
Once you have the app open, just type anything in the text field and press "send" to see the result.
There are special results for entering "dog" or "elephant."

There is also a secret button near the bottom of the screen that will show an image once tapped.
